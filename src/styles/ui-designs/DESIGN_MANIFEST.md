# ZaddyTools UI Design Manifest

## Coordination File
Each agent should read this file before creating their designs to avoid duplicates.
After creating designs, update this file with your design themes.

## Design Guidelines
- Each design should be a complete theme override for globals.css
- Maintain functionality but drastically change visual appearance
- Keep dark theme base but vary colors, shapes, typography, animations
- Each CSS file should be self-contained with all necessary overrides
